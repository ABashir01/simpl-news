# simpl-news
The intention of this website would be, by not using any JS and only using minimal CSS, to create a quick-loading, text-only website that can be used to easily access news articles even with poor internet connection. To form these articles, multiple websites will be scraped for article text and then presented in a text-only, easy to read format. I will add functions to scrape further websites and sort them into more sections as time permits.
