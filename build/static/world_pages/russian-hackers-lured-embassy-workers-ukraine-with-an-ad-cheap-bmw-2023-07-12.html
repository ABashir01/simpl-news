The SVR did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment about the hacking campaign.</p><p>In April, Polish counterintelligence and cybersecurity authorities warned that the same group had conducted a "widespread intelligence campaign" against NATO member states, the European Union, and Africa.</p><p>Researchers at Unit 42 were able to tie the fake car advert back to the SVR because the hackers re-used certain tools and techniques which have previously been connected to the spy agency.</p><p>"Diplomatic missions will always be a high-value espionage target," the Unit 42 report said. "Sixteen months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, intelligence surrounding Ukraine and allied diplomatic efforts are almost certainly a high priority for the Russian government".</p><p>The Polish diplomat said he had sent the original advert to various embassies in Kyiv, and that someone had called him back because the price looked "attractive".</p><p>"When I checked, I realised they were talking about a slightly lower price," the diplomat told Reuters.</p><p>SVR hackers, it turns out, had listed the diplomat's BMW for a lower price - 7,500 euros - in their fake version of the advert, in an attempt to encourage more people to download malicious software that would give them remote access to their devices, Reuters found.</p><p>That software, Unit 42 said, was disguised as an album of photographs of the used BMW. Attempts to open those photographs would have infected the target's machine, the report said.</p><p>Twenty-one of the 22 embassies targeted by the hackers and subsequently contacted by Reuters did not provide comment. It was not clear which embassies, if any, had been compromised.</p><p>A U.S. State Department spokesperson said they were "aware of the activity and based on the Directorate of Cyber and Technology Security's analysis found it did not affect Department systems or accounts."</p><p>As for the car, it was still available, the Polish diplomat told Reuters:</p><p>"I'll try to sell it in Poland, probably," he said. "After this situation, I don't want to have any more problems".</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-hackers-lured-embassy-workers-ukraine-with-an-ad-cheap-bmw-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
