The agency did not specify whether this was part of his conversation with Burns.</p><p>"It's natural that negotiations will be possible sooner or later, because any conflict, including armed conflict, ends by negotiations, but the conditions for these still need to ripen," TASS quoted him as saying.</p><p>Asked about the report, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters: "Today, someone like Naryshkin has no leverage over how this war will end."</p><p>Podolyak said Russia was losing the war and there could be no negotiations with people like Naryshkin.</p><p>"This Russian elite perceives events completely inadequately, so there is nothing to talk about with them."</p><p>Ukraine, which launched a long-expected counteroffensive last month, has said it will not enter talks at this point as this could effectively freeze the situation on the battlefield, where Russia has seized more than a sixth of its territory.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-spy-chief-says-he-held-ukraine-call-with-cia-head-tass-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
