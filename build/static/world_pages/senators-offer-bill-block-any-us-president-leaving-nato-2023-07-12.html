He is expected to celebrate its unity over Ukraine in a speech at the Vilnius summit on Wednesday.</p><p>The summit included an inaugural session of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body established to upgrade relations between Kyiv and the 31-member transatlantic military alliance.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/world/us/senators-offer-bill-block-any-us-president-leaving-nato-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
