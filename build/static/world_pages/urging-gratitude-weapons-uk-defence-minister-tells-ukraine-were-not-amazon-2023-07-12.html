"I told them that last year, when I drove 11 hours to be given a list."</p><p>On Wednesday Zelenskiy softened his tone, saying that the results of the summit had been good even if there had not been a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, and that he had received positive news on defence packages from allies.</p><p>In a news conference Zelenskiy said he did not understand Wallace's comments.</p><p>"We were always grateful to the UK, prime ministers and the minister of defence because the people are always supporting us," he said.</p><p>"I didn't know what he meant and how else we should be grateful. Maybe the minister wants something special but we have wonderful relations."</p><p>Asked about Wallace's comments, Sunak said that Zelenskiy had been grateful for the support given so far and that more support would be forthcoming as required.</p><p>"President Zelenskiy has expressed his gratitude for what we have done on a number of occasions," Sunak told a press conference at the summit in Vilnius.</p><p>"I completely understand Volodymyr's desire to do everything he can to protect his people and to stop this war, and we will continue to give him the support that he needs."</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/world/urging-gratitude-weapons-uk-defence-minister-tells-ukraine-were-not-amazon-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
