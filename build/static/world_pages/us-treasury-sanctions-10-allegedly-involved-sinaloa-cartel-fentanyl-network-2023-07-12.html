The fourth son, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, was captured in Mexico earlier this year.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned an import-export company, REI Compania Internacional, and its majority shareholder for allegedly receiving chemical shipments from China.</p><p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said after the Treasury announcement that the U.S. was acting "responsibly" in the fight against fentanyl and other drugs but that more needed to be done.</p><p>"It is necessary to attend the causes of the problem," he said during his regular morning news conference. "It's complex."</p><p>Lopez Obrador added that his Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodriguez would meet this month with U.S. Homeland Security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall to discuss the problem.</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has been seeking increased cooperation from Mexico and China in stemming the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-treasury-sanctions-10-allegedly-involved-sinaloa-cartel-fentanyl-network-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
