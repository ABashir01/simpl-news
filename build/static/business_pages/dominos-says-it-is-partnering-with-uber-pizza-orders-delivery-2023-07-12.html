The deal also calls for Uber to share some customer order data with Domino's.</p><p>The company has been raising the prices of menu items and increasing delivery charges as it looks to shield margins from high input costs after consumers turned to home-cooked meals during a sticky cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>In April, Domino's said its delivery same-store sales declined 2.1% in the first quarter, compared to a year ago. It is set to report second-quarter earnings on July 24.</p><p>"The partnership will likely boost Domino's struggling domestic delivery sales and improve franchisee economics," said BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, adding that benefits would begin accruing only in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Domino's said it will look to transition to making deliveries through Uber Eats in 27 international markets this year, including in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, which are common to the two companies.</p><p>The agreement would potentially allow Uber to take an incremental share over the next several quarters from the virtual duopoly it has with DoorDash (DASH.N) in the U.S., said Angelo Zino of CFRA Research.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dominos-says-it-is-partnering-with-uber-pizza-orders-delivery-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
