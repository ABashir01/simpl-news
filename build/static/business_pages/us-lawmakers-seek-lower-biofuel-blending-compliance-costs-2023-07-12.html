Issues around the RFS typically draw strong lobbying efforts from both oil refining advocates and biofuel advocates.</p><p>The bill must pass both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives before it could reach President Joe Biden's desk, who would decide whether to sign it into law.</p><p>Renewable fuel credits traded at $1.54 each on Tuesday after the bill came out, down from $1.56 prior, traders said. Credits traded on Wednesday between $1.55 and $1.56 each amid U.S. government data release.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-lawmakers-seek-lower-biofuel-blending-compliance-costs-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
