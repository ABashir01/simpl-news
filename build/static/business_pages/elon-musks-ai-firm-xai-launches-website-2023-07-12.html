GPT-3.5, and GPT-4," the startup said on its website.</p><p>The company, which is looking for experienced engineers and researchers to join its team as technical staff in the Bay Area, will hold a Twitter Spaces event on July 14.</p><p>Musk's startup will work closely with his other companies including Twitter and Tesla, according to the website.</p><p>Tesla shares showed little reaction to the news and were trading 1.5% higher, a sign that investors were not worried the startup will be a potential distraction for Musk.</p><p>The billionaire in March registered a firm named X.AI Corp, incorporated in Nevada, according to a state filing. The firm lists Musk as the sole director and Jared Birchall, the managing director of Musk's family office, as a secretary.</p><p>The Financial Times reported in April that Musk had secured thousands of high-powered GPU processors from Nvidia for the project.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musks-ai-firm-xai-launches-website-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
