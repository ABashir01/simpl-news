"It is not for the bank to concern itself with the wisdom or risks of its customer's payment decisions."</p><p>The court conceded such frauds caused great hardship for victims but said it was a matter ultimately for parliament to consider who should bear the losses, noting that the new Financial Services and Markets Act provided for a mandatory reimbursement scheme in some cases of domestic fraud.</p><p>Overseas payments will not be covered by the proposed scheme, however.</p><p>Barclays said it welcomed a decision that provided "certainty and clarity" on an important issue of law.</p><p>James Levy, a partner at law firm Ashurst, said the onus was on customers to ensure payment instructions were bona fide.</p><p>"It closes the significant risk of what might otherwise have been a flood of litigation against the nation's banks brought by customers who have been victims of APP fraud," he said.</p><p>The Supreme Court, however, allowed Philipp to pursue an alternative case against Barclays on the grounds that the bank breached its duty by failing to take adequate steps to recover the money transferred to the UAE.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/barclays-wins-uk-supreme-court-case-over-push-payment-fraud-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
