Our strategy has not changed and we run the company to invest through the cycle. We are building for the long-term and will continue to invest in recruiting, training and technology," JPMorgan said in a statement, adding the layoffs were part of its regular review.</p><p>The bank said it has 560 positions open in New Jersey and is working on redeploying the ones affected by the job cuts. It deploys 12,000 people in New Jersey.</p><p>A WARN, which is mandated by U.S. labor law, requires companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days' advance notification of plant closings and mass layoffs.</p><p>In May, JPMorgan was looking at laying off 500 employees across various departments. It also laid off nearly 1,000 First Republic Bank employees after it acquired the failed bank earlier this year.</p><p>The largest lender in the U.S. also cut nearly 40 investment banking jobs last month after a slump in dealmaking activity.</p><p>Rivals Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup (C.N) have also laid off investment bankers as uncertainty weighs on economic activity.</p><p>(This story has been corrected to clarify that the information about 500 layoffs was from a source, not from the bank, in paragraph 7)</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-plans-63-job-cuts-jersey-city-2023-07-11'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
