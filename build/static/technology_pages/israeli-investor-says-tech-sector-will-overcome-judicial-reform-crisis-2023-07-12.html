Funding raised by tech startups has fallen nearly 70% in the first half of 2023 while many new firms are registering overseas.</p><p>"We're going to overcome it and I think that the people that are trying to derail democracy today would be gone tomorrow," Erel Margalit, chairman of Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) and a former Labour Party lawmaker, said, referring to Netanyahu's ruling coalition of religious and nationalist parties.</p><p>"The big inventors are the warriors of democracy," Margalit told Reuters on the sidelines of a JVP Climate Tech conference.</p><p>Tech leaders including Barak Eilam, a former Israeli intelligence officer who now heads cloud-based software provider NICE (NICE.TA) and Eynat Guez, chief executive of Papaya Global, have been among the most vocal against the judicial legislation.</p><p>On Monday, parliament passed a key element in the bill, which aims to curb the power of the Supreme Court. In response, thousands on Tuesday blockaded Israel's main airport and highways.</p><p>Israel's shekel gained 1% versus the dollar on Wednesday while Tel Aviv shares jumped nearly 2% on a perception that Tuesday's protests were succeeding in pressuring the government. But the shekel remained some 7% lower over the past six months.</p><p>While the tech sector needs a stable Israeli economy, the economy needs a strong tech sector, which accounts for 14% of jobs and almost a fifth of gross domestic product. The fall off in tech funding has been a major factor in the weakening of the shekel , analysts say.</p><p>Margalit said there was still some funding available and that he had just raised "a lot of money for our companies", some at high valuations.</p><p>"Nothing is easy today and it's not the time where a lot of new investors are coming in by the thousands. But it's a time to keep your friends close," he said.</p><p>Israelis, he added, will continue to create startups but the main issue is where most of the workers will be - in Israel or abroad.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-investor-says-tech-sector-will-overcome-judicial-reform-crisis-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
