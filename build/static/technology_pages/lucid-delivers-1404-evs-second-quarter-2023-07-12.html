Its production fell 6% sequentially to 2,173 vehicles.</p><p>The company had trimmed its 2023 production forecast and reported a lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue in May as it took a hit from Tesla's price war and rising interest rates.</p><p>"We continue to view Lucid as a broken growth story and its ramp up rate has been particularly disappointing considering its newer, state-of-the-art factory in Casa Grande, Arizona," CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said.</p><p>Lucid's Air luxury sedans start at $87,400, putting them in direct competition with the Elon Musk-led automaker's Model S that costs $88,490.</p><p>"We continue to believe significant price cuts are needed on the Air, particularly in light of increasing competition, in order to stimulate demand," Nelson added.</p><p>Lucid has also been struggling with a cash crunch and had unveiled plans in May to raise about $3 billion through a stock offering, nearly two-thirds of which would come from its largest investor Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p><p>Last month, the EV maker signed a deal with Aston Martin (AML.L), giving the British company access to its electric powertrain and battery technologies in return for a 3.7% stake.</p><p>Lucid said it would report financial results for the second quarter on Aug. 7 after markets close.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lucid-delivers-1404-evs-second-quarter-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
