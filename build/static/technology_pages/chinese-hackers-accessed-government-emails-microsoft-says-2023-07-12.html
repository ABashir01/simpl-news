The activity began in May, Microsoft said.</p><p>"As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has contacted all targeted or compromised organizations directly via their tenant admins and provided them with important information to help them investigate and respond," the company added.</p><p>Microsoft did not say which organizations or governments had been affected, but added that the hacking group involved primarily targets entities in Western Europe.</p><p>China's embassy in London called the accusation "disinformation" and called the U.S. government "the world's biggest hacking empire and global cyber thief." China routinely denies involvement in hacking operations regardless of the available evidence or context.</p><p>White House National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said an intrusion in Microsoft's cloud security "affected unclassified systems," without elaborating.</p><p>"Officials immediately contacted Microsoft to find the source and vulnerability in their cloud service," Hodge added.</p><p>The State Department "detected anomalous activity" and "took immediate steps to secure our systems," a department spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>Private sector cybersecurity experts have said newly discovered hacking activity shows how Chinese groups are improving their cyber capabilities.</p><p>"Chinese cyber espionage has come a long way from the smash-and-grab tactics many of us are familiar with," said John Hultquist, chief analyst for U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-hackers-accessed-government-emails-microsoft-says-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
