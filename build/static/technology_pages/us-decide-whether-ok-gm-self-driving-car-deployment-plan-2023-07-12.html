National Highway Traffic Safety acting Administrator Ann Carlson said Wednesday the agency "will issue a decision "in the coming weeks."</p><p>"The central issue is deciding whether vehicles that are driven not by humans but by computers need to comply with safety standards that are fundamentally about human drivers: requirements for mirrors, sun visors, windshield wipers and so forth," Carlson said.</p><p>Cruise declined to comment.</p><p>Cruise currently offers a limited service in San Francisco with a small fleet of Chevrolet Bolt vehicles fitted with driverless technology. Cruise wants to deploy its Origin vehicle, which has subway-like doors and no steering wheels.</p><p>In 2018, GM petitioned the NHTSA to allow a car built on a Chevrolet Bolt without steering wheels or brake pedals on U.S. roads. In 2020, GM withdrew the petition after the agency took no action.</p><p>The NHTSA can also exempt autonomous vehicles, or AVs, for research and demonstration purposes. Carlson said the agency is looking to establish a new program that "would provide additional transparency about AV safety and deployment while giving the public assurance that NHTSA is overseeing the deployment of AVs on our public streets."</p><p>Congress has been debating for years whether to pass legislation on self-driving cars, and a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee is planning a hearing later this month.</p><p>In 2017, the House passed legislation to speed the adoption of self-driving cars, bar states from setting performance standards and expand the number of vehicles that could be deployed with exemptions, but the measure never passed the Senate.</p><p>In December, the NHTSA opened a formal safety probe into the autonomous driving system in vehicles produced by Cruise after reports of two injuries in rear-end crashes. The NHTSA said Cruise vehicles "may engage in inappropriately hard braking or become immobilized."</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-decide-whether-ok-gm-self-driving-car-deployment-plan-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
