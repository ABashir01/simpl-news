Walmart is also using the week as a way to lure more customers to its subscription program Walmart+ by offering 50% discount on annual membership sign-ups.</p><p>Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of retail at Salesforce, said that shoppers have now been conditioned to compare deals from various retailers during Prime Day week, meaning rising competition for Amazon.</p><p>Garf said that although people are shopping online, retailers are seeing a drop in conversion rates -- the measure of consumers who visit a store compared to those who make purchases.</p><p>"That's telling us is each visit is less profitable," Garf said. Amazon offered steep discounts to "positively influence" membership sign ups when Prime Day launched in 2015 and now Walmart is "taking a page out of the Amazon playbook," he said.</p><p>Prime Day week deals aren't "just about the initial sale and providing a discount, but it's Walmart and others looking to gain new customers and turning them into strong lifetime value of those customers," Garf said.</p><p>International Council of Shopping Centers Chief Executive Tom McGee said that deal events like Prime Day, Walmart+ Week and Target Deal days "drive spending across the board, including at both small and large retailers."</p><p>Shoppers can find the biggest discount across retailers of 16% on electronics on Wednesday.  Apparel is discounted at 13%, while toys would be 15% cheaper, according to Adobe Digital Insights.</p><p>Adobe's Pandey said Prime Day is a chance to stock up on back to-school items, especially apparel and electronics, whose sales were up 26% and 12%, respectively, compared to average daily sales in June.</p><p>Data from Deloitte showed 69% of shoppers planned to rely on Prime Day sale for back-to-school purchases. But that spending is expected to decline for the first time in nine years as sticky inflation hurts non-essential purchases, it said.</p><p>Adobe's data relies on direct consumer transactions based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly 900 Amazon workers at a warehouse in Coventry, Britain, are striking over a pay dispute for three days from July 11-13, coinciding with the Prime Day sales event.</p><p>Amazon said the site does not directly serve customer orders and there will be no disruption to customers.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-prime-day-sales-rise-deep-discounts-tempt-inflation-hit-customers-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
