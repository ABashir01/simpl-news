We will continue to work with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive," Meta's lawyer, Tim Lamb, said in a statement.</p><p>The company could face a fine up to 10% of its global turnover and an order to change its business practices if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. It had previously sought to settle the case, people familiar with the matter had told Reuters.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-contest-eu-antitrust-charges-july-13-hearing-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
