Still, with the larger $69 billion deal back on track, the two sides are now focused on modifying the deal to obtain regulatory approval.</p><p>Jonathan Compton, partner at law firm DMH Stallard and a specialist in competition law, said it was difficult to see what structural alterations the company could make.</p><p>"Were it to do so, it could face fresh inquiry from the FTC and or the Commission," he said, of the U.S. and EU regulators.</p><p>Euclid's McGrath added: "how do you reset the clock just for the CMA process without resetting the clock everywhere?"</p><p>Britain's competition regulator has not given any further clarification on its U-turn or the new investigation, including whether it would fit into its Phase 1 and 2 process, the latter of which can take up to a year.</p><p>When CMA top boss Sarah Cardell in April announced the decision to block the deal, she was asked repeatedly if there was any way it could still go ahead.</p><p>"We have taken a decision to block the deal," she had said.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/uks-cma-says-new-restructured-microsoft-activision-deal-could-require-new-probe-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
