The Salt Lake City, Utah-based company's current partners include Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Roche (ROG.S).</p><p>Recursion is conducting human trials for five of its drugs, including a candidate that is in mid-stage trials to treat a type of neurovascular disease caused by malformation of small blood vessels in the brain.</p><p>Other prominent backers of the biotech include Abu Dhabi's sovereign investor Mubadala and UK-based investment firm Baillie Gifford & Co.</p><p>Recursion's shares were up at $12.40 in heavy volumes. They were on track for their best day ever since listing in 2021, if current gains hold through the session.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-invests-50-mln-recursion-train-ai-models-drug-discovery-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
