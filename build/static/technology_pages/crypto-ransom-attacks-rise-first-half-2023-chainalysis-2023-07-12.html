Transactions associated with sanctioned entities accounted for 44% of 2022's record-high $20.1 billion worth of crypto crime, Chainalysis said in January.</p><p>Revenue from scams also declined, which Chainalysis said went against the long-standing trend of people being more susceptible to scams in times of rising prices, due to "market exuberance" and "FOMO" (fear of missing out). But there was a rise in the number of people falling for impersonation scams, in which fraudsters pretend to be a law enforcement officer or other authority figure to extort money, Chainalysis said.</p><p>Crypto payments to ransomware attackers hit $449.1 million in the first half of 2023, up $175.8 million from the same period last year, Chainalysis said. If this continues, ransomware attackers will have their second best year on record, the analysts added.</p><p>"Big game hunting - that is, the targeting of large, deep-pocketed organizations by ransomware attackers - seems to have bounced back after a lull in 2022. At the same time, the number of successful small attacks has also grown," Chainalysis said.</p><p>Chainalysis's figures probably under-represent crypto's role in all crime. For example, they exclude when cryptocurrencies are the proceeds of non-crypto-related crimes, such as when cryptocurrency is used for payment in drug trafficking.</p><hr><h3>Source: <a href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-ransom-attacks-rise-first-half-2023-chainalysis-2023-07-12'>Reuters</a><h3></div>
